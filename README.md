# Car price prediction using linear models
This project uses three regression models namely linear regressor, random forest regressor and gradient boosting regressor to predict the car price based on various categorical features. and compare their performance.    
## Model's used:
* Linear Regression
* Random forest regressor
* Gradiant Boosting regressor

## Goal
* Evaluate the three models and compare their performance and results.
* Test them on dummy data.

## Data Source:
* Data is taken from kaggle, added dataset in repository is the preproccessed version of orignal data.
